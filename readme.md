# User Register and Login App

## Overview

The User Register and Login App is a secure and efficient web application designed to manage user authentication and session management. This project provides a fundamental framework for registering new users, authenticating registered users, and managing user sessions after login. It serves as an excellent starting point for any web application requiring user authentication.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account by providing their name, email, and password. The app includes validations to ensure that all information is correctly entered and that the email used for registration is unique.
- **Password Security**: Implements bcrypt hashing to securely store user passwords. This ensures that plain text passwords are never stored in the database, enhancing the security of user data.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users by their email and password. It includes error handling to manage common login errors such as incorrect password or email not found, improving the user experience by providing clear error messages.
- **Session Management**: Maintains user session information after login using express-session. This allows the application to persist user login states and provide a personalized user experience.
- **Logout Functionality**: Enables users to securely logout, which clears their session and redirects them to the login page.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Serves as the runtime environment for the application.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data securely.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
- **Passport.js**: An authentication middleware for Node.js that is extremely flexible and fully supports custom authentication strategies.
- **bcrypt.js**: A library to help you hash passwords securely.
- **EJS**: A templating engine used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It provides templated views, which helps in generating dynamic web pages based on passing arguments.
- **Express-session**: Middleware for handling sessions in Express applications.
